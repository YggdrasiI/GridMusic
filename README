Description
-----------

This program can receive TUIO messages and 
create midi messages. It contains predifined handlers
to convert touch information into piano keypresses or
to invoke other midi commands.
Extending a base class allows the creation of further 'effects'

The program is written in the Keykit programming language and
requires Keykit³. Keykit is available for certain machines (e.g. Windows 95/98/NT/W2K/XP and x86-Linux).

Created 2012 by Olaf Schulz ( funwithkinect@googlemail.com ).

Why?
----
GridMusic fills the gap beetween TUIO generators like
the Kinect driven 'KincetGrid'¹ or 'Space Palette'² by Tim Thompson and 
midi devices/synthesizers.  


Status
------
 TODO


Usage Notes
-----
- Required form of TUIO messages:
  /tuio/25Dblb set [areaid*1000+handid] [x] [y] [z]   ; x,y,z ∈[0,1]

============= Install ===================
See INSTALL.

============= Usage ===================
To load the default setting, type the following into
the command line window of keykit:
  > k = new kinect("settingPiano", 1)
  > [...]
  > k.stop()
  > deleteobject(k)

The object listen at the port OSCPORT (default: 3335) for TUIO messages.
To load the same setting without gui (lowkey), you can use 
scripts/lowkey.sh. Check scripts/environment.sh if Keykit do not start.
  > cd GridMusic/scripts
  > ./lowkey settingPiano

If you want define own settings look into settings.k and copy one of them
into mysettings.k and extend the array SETTINGS by the new entry, i.e.
  SETTINGS["{name}"] = {function}.

Each setting function return an list of area-objects. Object 0 fetches the touch
event on area 0 and so on...
Some areas:
	•area_piano : Plays one note. Pitch, duration and volume is selected by hand position.
	•area_playmidi : Require list of midi files. Play & Stop midis if area is touched.
	•area_bpm : Change the global bpm.
	•area_volume : Change the global volume. Sends osc message with new volume.
	•area_stepfile : Like piano class but plays the n-th note of some given phrase.
	•area_setting_switcher : Switch between different settings (=allocation of areas).
