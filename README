============= Description ==========

This program can receive TUIO messages and 
create midi messages. It's possible to
simulate a keyboard, start midi files, record
phrases and it's easy to create new touchpad (called areas)
functions.

GridMusic fills the gap beetween TUIO generators like
the Kinect driven 'KincetGrid'¹ or 'Space Palette'² by Tim Thompson and 
midi devices.  

The program is written in the Keykit programming language and
requires Keykit³. Keykit is available for certain machines (e.g. Windows 95/98/NT/W2K/XP and x86-Linux).

Required TUIO message form:
/tuio/25Dblb set [areaid*1000+handid] [x] [y] [z]   ; x,y,z ∈[0,1]

============= Install ===================
See INSTALL.

============= Usage ===================
0. Look at kinect.k
1. Set OSCPORT (default 3335) to your desired port.
2. Write a class MYAREA (or use the examples in the kinect_areas*-files) which inherit from
area
3. Create an instance of your area
		myarea = new MYAREA([...])
	and call
		looper([1=myarea], [])
	Now, all updates of area 1 will call the update handler of myarea…

4. Look at the settings*() methodes in kinect.k for some examples.
	I.e. setting0() connect the first area with a simple major scale.

5. Some example areas:
	•area_piano : Plays one note. Pitch, duration and volume is selected by hand position.
	•area_playmidi : Require list of midi files. Play & Stop midis if area is touched.
	•area_bpm : Change the global bpm.
	•area_volume : Change the global volume. Sends osc message with new volume.
	•area_stepfile : Like piano class but plays the n-th note of some given phrase.
	•area_setting_switcher : Switch between different settings (=allocation of areas).
