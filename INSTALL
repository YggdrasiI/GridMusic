The Software is written in the script language of Keykit and
tested with version 7.7b. You can download executables and
sources on http://nosuch.com/keykit/ .


On Windows
----------
• Install Keykit.
• Clone the repository into [KEYKIT ROOT DIR]\contrib\kinect.
• Add '#include contrib/kinect/kinect.k' to your keylocal.k
  file or type this line manually into the terminal window in 
	keykit.


On Linux
--------
It's nessesary to patch the code¹...
• Download source code of keykit 7.7b and extract it.
• Rename MAKEFILE src/MAKEFILLE to Makefile.
• Make some scripts executable:
    chmod +x mdep/stdio/rmcr 
		chmod +x byacc/byacc
• Recompile byacc:
	cd byacc
	rm byacc
	mv makefile.unx makefile
	make clean
	make
	
• Copy from this repository
   Makefile.patch 
   linux_alsa_-_osc_messages_v2.patch
  into keykit's root directory and patch
   patch -p1 < Makefile.patch
	 patch -p1 < linux_alsa_-_osc_messages_v2.patch
• Clean up and compile:
	make clean_linux
	make install_linux_alsa
=> Executables are created in ./bin/ .
• Add '#include contrib/kinect/kinect.k' to your keylocal.k
  file or type this line manually into the terminal window in 
	keykit.

Hints: 
  - Create ./keylocal.k to enable alsa output port on startup.
	function keylocal(){
			outalsa = outport(1)
			mapport(0,outalsa) 
	}
	Now, 'aconnect -i' shows an entry for keykit which can connect to a synthesiser.
